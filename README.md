# My project was made on algorithms in computers and entertainment platforms. I chose this because I was interested how something so vague can be so helpful as a tool across many different entities in computer science. I talk about different types of sorts but also focused on bubble vs insertion sorts and drew comparisons for how they work. I was very interested in understanding the differences of sorts especially after I coded with the bubble sort in MS visual last semester. Thank you!
